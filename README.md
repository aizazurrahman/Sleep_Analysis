# Sleep_Analysis
  I decided to take on this project when I watched Joe Roegan's podcast on importance of sleep with Matthew Walker, Director of the Center for Human Sleep Science (20 sec clip here - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gDYYqXcYuJQ , full 2 hour video here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwaWilO_Pig).  
  
  After watching the podcast, I wanted to analyze my own sleeping patterns as I always had trouble with sleep and to support my project, I had my Samsung-Health sleep data gathered from Aug-18 to Mar-23 as I wore a smartwatch 6 years . Surprising findings - less than 5 hours of average sleep reacorded over entire timeline of 6 years. Go to 'Sleep Analysis.ipynb' for details and visualizations. Dataset hidden for privacy reasons as it contains my everyday sleep data for last 6 years. You can request it by email to mart.q6@gmail.com

## About Data
  Dataset contains information of each sleep session. If a person sleeps more than once on the same day, it is recorded as two separate sessions instead of merging the data.
## Challenges
  Challenges include aligning data from multiple different timezones, managing time-series analysis and data quality issues due to data discrepancies from multiple data sourcing devices (different versions of watch with 
  different software)
## Data Quality Issues
  Data-quality issues include inconsistent field data-types
