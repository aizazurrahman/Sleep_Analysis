# Sleep_Analysis
  Analyzing my sleep patterns with 6 years of Samsung Health sleep data gathered from Aug-18 to Mar-23. Surprising findings - less than 5 hours of average sleep reacorded over entire timeline of 6 years. Go to 'Sleep Analysis.ipynb' for details and visualizations. Dataset hidden for privacy reasons as it contains my everyday sleep data for last 6 years. You can request it by email to mart.q6@gmail.com
## About Data
  Data contains information of each sleep session. If a person sleeps more than once on the same day, it is recorded as two separate sessions instead of merging the data.
## Challenges
  Challenges include aligning data from multiple different timezones, managing time-series analysis and data quality issues due to data discrepancies from multiple data sourcing devices (different versions of watch with 
  different software)
## Data Quality Issues
  Data-quality issues include inconsistent field data-types
