# Sleep_Analysis
  Analyzing my sleep patterns from 6 years of Samsung Health sleep data gathered from Aug-18 to Mar-23
## About Data
  Data contains information of each sleep session. If a person sleeps more than once on the same day, it is recorded as two separate sessions instead of merging the data.
## Challenges
  Challenges include aligning data from multiple different timezones, managing time-series analysis and data quality issues due to data discrepancies from multiple data sourcing devices (different versions of watch with 
  different software)
## Data Quality Issues
  Data-quality issues include inconsistent field data-types
